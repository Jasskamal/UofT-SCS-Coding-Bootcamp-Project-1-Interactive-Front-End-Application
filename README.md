# UofT-SCS-Coding-Bootcamp-Project-1-Interactive-Front-End-Application

This is an interactive application with a polished user friendly UI. 
Users are able to research their favorite Marvel characters, while being shown a multitude of links to obtain information from. While they look, there is detailed images displaying their character search!
We have a searchbar, general Marvel database and a random movie generator that allows users access to a randomly chosen Marvel movie!

There are several technologies used to make this front end application, such as Spectre CSS framework, Wikipedia API, Jquery, Javascript, Bootstrap, and Google Font API.
